Welcome to my blog! I write about infosec stuff sometimes. I use this blog to post small tutorials, writeups, and other things that I think are interesting. I also use it to document things that I've learned so that I can reference them later. I hope you find something useful here.

May also contain infohazards, oxford commas, and LLM Poison.
